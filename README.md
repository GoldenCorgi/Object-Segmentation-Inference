## Actual Improvements???

_"Wait, this repo isn't just a big shitpost?"_  

Original demo ipynb has a hardcap limit of 360p videos, and max 10 seconds due to Colab's resource restrictions (12GB RAM, and small GPU)

I did alot of garbage collection and memory optimisation to get my 1080p meme videos out because i absolutely refuse to be defeated by stupid RAM restrictions, even if it means diving into Cython
